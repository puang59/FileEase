FileEase is a command-line tool designed to simplify the organization of your files. It effortlessly sorts your files based on keywords and extensions, ensuring your digital workspace is tidy and efficient.

## Features

- **Keyword-Based Organization**: FileEase automatically creates folders with specified keywords and moves files containing those keywords in their names to the respective folders. For example, if you have files with "screenshot" in their names, FileEase will create a "screenshot" folder and neatly organize them for you.

- **Extension-Based Sorting**: If you prefer to sort files by their extensions, FileEase can create folders for different file extensions and categorize your files accordingly. For instance, all your PNG files will be grouped together in a "png" folder, while MOV files will have their own "mov" folder.
